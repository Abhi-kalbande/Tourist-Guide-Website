            <h1>Amritsar</h1>

<h4>Amritsar, Punjab’s Biggest City</h4>
<p>Amritsar, the spiritual and cultural heart of Punjab, is renowned for its rich history, spiritual significance, and vibrant heritage. The city is home to the Golden Temple, the most revered shrine of Sikhism, attracting millions of visitors from across the globe.</p>

<h2>The Golden Temple: A Symbol of Peace and Devotion</h2>
<p>The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, was first constructed in 1604 by Guru Arjan Dev, the Fifth Sikh Guru, who also installed the holy Guru Granth Sahib in its sanctum. The shrine, surrounded by the sacred Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), symbolizes humility and universal brotherhood. Its golden dome glows beautifully, reflecting in the serene waters, making it a breathtaking sight at any time of the day.</p>

<h2>Historical Significance</h2>
<p>The foundation of the Golden Temple was laid by the Muslim saint Mian Mir, highlighting the inclusive and secular ideals of Sikhism. Over the centuries, the temple has withstood various invasions and reconstructions, symbolizing the resilience and unwavering faith of the Sikh community.</p>

<h2>The Sacred Pool and Its Legends</h2>
<p>The sacred pool, Amrit Sarovar, after which the city is named, was sanctified by Guru Ram Das in the 16th century. According to legends, this pool has miraculous healing properties and has been associated with Indian mythology for thousands of years. It is believed that Lord Rama’s sons, Luv and Kush, were taught the Ramayana at this very site.</p>

<h2>The Tragic Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</h2>
<p>Amritsar is also remembered for the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on April 13, 1919. British officer General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to open fire on an unarmed crowd, killing over 300 innocent civilians and wounding thousands. This brutal incident became a turning point in India’s freedom struggle and is commemorated by a memorial at Jallianwala Bagh, which stands as a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made for India's independence.</p>

<h2>Connectivity and Accessibility</h2>
<p>Amritsar is well connected with major Indian cities through air, rail, and road. Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport serves both domestic and international flights, making it an important travel hub. The city’s railway station connects it to major destinations like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, while an extensive road network ensures smooth bus and private vehicle travel.</p>
